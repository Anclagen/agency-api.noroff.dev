        "At Crab Apple Inc., where apples aren’t just fruits – they’re a lifestyle, we’re searching for a highly specialized individual to join our elite Appletonaut team. As an Apple Orbital Launcher Specialist, you'll play a pivotal role in our secret mission: Project Appollo, aimed at making Crab Apples the first interstellar fruit. Use our patented “Apple-pult” to send apples into the stratosphere and beyond.  Ensure that the launched apples avoid interstellar worm-eating space worms and navigate through the Milky Way. Collaborate with our Starfish division to recover apples once they have orbited and completed their space mission. Craft cosmic apple jams using the interstellar ingredients the apples collect on their journeys. Ensure all apples are equipped with tiny apple-sized space helmets and O2 packs. Crab Apple Inc. is an equal fruit opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all apple-thusiasts. Interested applicants may apply by sending their CVs attached to a helium balloon or by pigeon mail to our Treehouse #7. Only those applicants shortlisted for the next round – the Great Apple Juggle – will be contacted.",
